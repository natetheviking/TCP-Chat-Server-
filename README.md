TCP Chat Server/Multi-user chat server 
A TCP Chat Server, specifically a multi-user chat server, is a network application that allows multiple clients to connect and communicate with each other in a real-time chat environment over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In a multi-user chat server, clients can send and receive messages to/from each other, creating a virtual chat room where users can interact.
Here's an overview of how a multi-user chat server using TCP works:
Server Setup:
The chat server is set up and listens on a specific port for incoming connections from clients.
It uses TCP as the underlying communication protocol for reliable data transmission.

Client Connection: Clients (users) connect to the server using their respective IP addresses and port numbers. The server accepts these incoming connections.
Message Communication: Once connected, clients can send and receive messages through the server. Each client's message is sent to the server, which then broadcasts the message to all connected clients. This way, all clients can see each other's messages.

Broadcasting Messages: The server acts as a central hub for message distribution. When it receives a message from one client, it sends the message to all other connected clients. This ensures that all participants in the chat room receive the message in real-time.

Handling Multiple Clients: The server typically uses threading or asynchronous programming to handle multiple clients concurrently. Each client connection is managed in a separate thread or event loop, allowing the server to serve multiple clients simultaneously.

Exiting and clean up: Clients can exit the chat by closing their connection. The server detects this disconnection and informs other clients about the departure of the user. Proper cleanup of resources is important to handle client disconnects gracefully.

Usernames and Identification: Clients might have unique usernames or identifiers in a real-world scenario. The server can use this information to personalize messages and interactions.
